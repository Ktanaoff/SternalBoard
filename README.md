## How to integrate
If you want to integrate SternalBoard to your proyect, you can use Maven and Gradle:
Before nothing, remember that you need jitpack for it (https://jitpack.io/#ShieldCommunity/SternalBoard)

## Maven
```xml
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.github.ShieldCommunity</groupId>
            <artifactId>SternalBoard</artifactId>
            <version>2.3.1</version>
            <scope>compile</scope>
        </dependency>
```

## Gradle
```gradle
plugins {
    id 'com.github.johnrengelman.shadow' version '8.1.1'
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.xism4.sternalboard:2.3.1'
}

shadowJar {
    relocate 'com.xism4.sternalboard', 'you.package.like.scoreboard'
}
```

## Gradle DSL
```kts
plugins {
    id("com.github.johnrengelman.shadow") version("8.1.1")
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation("com.xism4:sternalboard:2.3.1")
}

shadowJar {
    relocate("com.xism4.sternalboard", "you.yourpackage.like.scoreboard")
}
```

## Manually
You can copy the classes and paste them into your project if you are not yet using a dependency system such as gradle or maven

## How to hook into it
With a simple call you can create your first scoreboard

```java
public class ExampleBoard {

    public void setScoreboard(Player player){
        SternalBoardHandler board = new SternalBoardHandler(player);

        board.updateTitle(ChatColor.GREEN+
                "Hypixel.net" //You can make it configurable trough strings tho
        );

        board.updateLines("Hello", //You can do lines as your version allows!
                "shieldcommunity.net",
        );
    }
}

```
